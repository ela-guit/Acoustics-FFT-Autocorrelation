# Intro

This is an old school project related to computational physics that I completed in December, 2018, in my 3rd year of undergrad physics at the University of Toronto. In the "Final files" folder you find
a pdf write-up "Analysis of Sound.pdf" that details my project.

The python files and sound files used to generate these results can be found in the "Analysis files" folder.

# Project Description

Sound can be analyzed as a wave. I use the Fast Fourier Transform method and autocorrelation method to analyze reverbation properties
of sound.

The takeaway of this project is that autocorrelation can be used to observe spectral properties of a waveform that Fast Fourier transforms might not.

Thank you, enjoy.
